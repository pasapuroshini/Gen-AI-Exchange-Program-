### 📌 **Prompt Engineering Fundamentals**

**Goal**: Improve the quality and relevance of responses from LLMs (Large Language Models).

#### ✅ Best Practices:

*   **Be Clear and Specific**→ Define the task precisely. Avoid vague instructions.
    
*   **Be Concise**→ Use minimal language to express the full task requirement.
    
*   **One Task at a Time**→ Break down complex instructions. LLMs perform better with focused tasks.
    
*   **Use Examples (Few-shot prompting)**→ Provide input-output examples to guide the model.
    

#### 🔄 Convert Tasks:

*   **Generative → Classification Tasks**→ For better control and evaluation.Example:Instead of: “Write an email reply.”Use: “Classify the tone of this email: Formal / Informal / Urgent.”
